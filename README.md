#Northwind Database SQL Query writing project.
For this particular project I downloaded the Northwind database BAK(Backup file) and uploaded on to MS Sequel Server to restore the database.
Afterwards I wrote SQL queries to solve critical business problems. The full projection details can be found HERE.
The SQL code is found under the SQL CODE section and the answers are found under the SQL Answers section.
