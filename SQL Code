	FROM Orders
	WHERE ShipCountry IN ('Germany’, 'Brazil');

Q.9: The business wants to know all the orders that are shipped to Latin America (i.e.: Brazil,Mexico,Argentina,Venezuela)

SELECT 
	OrderID,

Q.10: Select all the employees firstname, lastname, title and birthdate with the youngest person at the top
SELECT 
	FirstName,
	LastName,
	Title,
	BirthDate
	FROM Employees

ORDER BY BirthDate Desc;

Q.11: Please generate the full name of each employee.
SELECT
	Full_Name = FirstName + ' ' + LastName
	FROM Employees;

Q.12:The business wants to know the OrderID, ProductID, UnitPrice,Quantity and Total Price of the top 20 products.
SELECT	Top 20
		OrderID,
		ProductID,
		UnitPrice,
		Quantity,
		Total_Price = UnitPrice * Quantity

FROM [Order Details]
ORDER BY
	Total_Price DESC;

Q.13: Please generate the total no of customers
SELECT	
	Total_Customers = COUNT(*)

FROM Customers;

Q.14: The business wants to know when the first order was placed
SELECT	
	First_Order = MIN(OrderDate)
FROM Orders;

Q.15:The business wants to know all the countries they have customers
SELECT	DISTINCT
	Country

FROM Customers;

Q.16: The business wants to know the titles of all the customers
SELECT	
	ContactTitle,
	Total_ContactTitle = COUNT(*)

FROM Customers
GROUP BY ContactTitle
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

Q.17: The business wants to know the list of products and their suppliers
SELECT	
	ProductID,
	ProductName,
	Supplier_Name = CompanyName

FROM Products P
JOIN Suppliers S
ON P.SupplierID=S.SupplierID;

Q.18: The business wants a list of total products in each category
SELECT	
	CategoryName,
	Total_Product = COUNT(*)

FROM Products P
JOIN Categories C
ON P.CategoryID  = C.CategoryID

GROUP BY CategoryName
ORDER BY COUNT(*) desc;


Q.19: The business wants to know the total no of customers in each country
SELECT	
	Country,
	City,
	Total_Customers = COUNT(*)

FROM Customers

GROUP BY Country,
		 City
ORDER BY COUNT(*) desc;

Q.20: Please give me a list of all the products that needs re ordering
SELECT 
	ProductID,
	ProductName,
	UnitsInStock,
	ReorderLevel

FROM Products
WHERE UnitsInStock <= ReorderLevel
ORDER BY ProductID;

Q.21: The business wants a list of customers by region
SELECT 
	CustomerID,
	CompanyName,
	Region

FROM Customers
ORDER BY 
CASE When Region is NULL Then 1
	Else 0
End,
	Region,
	CustomerID;

In summary I had to use a wide range of SQL queries to answer those business questions, from simple SELECT statements to more complex queries involving  In, Join, Like, Null, , Where, joins,  Min, case, and aggregations elements.
